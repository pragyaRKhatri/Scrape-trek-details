# Scrape-trek-details
scraping trek details with request and beautifulsoup in python 

The Objective of this project is to scrape the "BikatAdventure" website and gather informations about various treks and related things in a CSV.

Here I have scrapped the Activities section of BikatAdventures. The activities are divided into 6 sections
- Summer Treks
- Winter Treks
- Offbeat Trails
- Expeditions
- South India Treks
- Western Ghats

Have used Request and BeautifulSoup with python, pandas and numpy to scrape this site.
At the end stored around 200 rows and 5 columns in different CSV's.

Summary
- We have extracted Data from BikatAdventures >> Activities
- Learned how to use BeautifulSoup to scrape webpage.
- Created a separate CSV with different Activities (Total 6)
- Further Scraped Each Row of the dataframe i.e. each category.
- Again repeated same process of scraping and created seperate CSV's with all the trek details
